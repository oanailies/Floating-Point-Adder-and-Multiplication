The design of an arithmetic-logic unit in floating point for addition and multiplication.
The goal of this project is to design a floating-point arithmetic logic unit, an essential 
component for complex numerical operations in computers. This unit will be developed to
operate in an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) environment, using the Vivado platform.
